			<h3>Information Collection Practices</h3>

			<h4>Visitor Data. </h4>

			<p>The Company automatically tracks certain information based upon your visit to and behavior on the Site. If you visit the Site or use the Online Services (even if you do not engage in a sales transaction), we may collect a variety of data from visitors, including IP addresses, URL, browser settings and plug-ins, screen resolutions, cookie preferences, search engine keywords, JavaScript enablement, internet service (ISP) information, referring/exit pages, computer profiles and operating systems, date/time stamps, clickstream data, traffic data, and all other "visitor" data that the Company may collect from visitors under applicable law (collectively, "Visitor Data"). Visitor Data may include the URL you just came from (whether on the Site or not), and the URL you next go to (whether on the Site or not). We may collect the IP addresses of the websites and pages you visit.</p>

			<p>Please note, while an ISP does not identify a user by his or her name, it may, with the cooperation of an ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Moreover, your IP address can reveal what geographic area from which you are connecting or which ISP you are using.</p>

			<p>Visitor Data may include other anonymous data which will help Us understand and analyze the Internet experience and behavior of our visitors. For example, the Company may collect visitor data relating to referring domain names.</p>

			<p>The Company uses servers and software that allows it to automatically recognize and capture Visitor Data. The Company may use Visitor Data for several reasons, including but not limited to: compiling traffic data about the types of visitors who use the Site at specific intervals ("Traffic Data"); using Traffic Data to analyze Site traffic; administer and optimize the Online Services; and, display or particularize content according to your preferences. When you provide Personal Information, We are able to use Visitor Data to identify you.</p>

			<p>Please note, moreover, we may use Visitor Data by sharing it or selling it to business partners, affiliates, or advertisers on an aggregated or anonymous basis.</p>

			<h4>Personally Identifiable Information. </h4>

			<p>Each time you provide or transmit information via the Site or speak with a customer service representative on the phone, We may obtain personal information from you, including: "Contact Data" (e.g., email address, name, address, telephone number(s), and carrier); "Financial Data" (e.g., credit or debit card number, expiration date, verification code, and bank account information); and "Demographic and Legal Data"(e.g., sex, age, zip code, other survey data, and social security number) (collectively, "Personal Information").</p>

			<p>This disclosure may occur when a visitor registers, engages in transactions, contacts customer service, or participates in contests, promotions, surveys (online or offline), forums, content submissions, requests for suggestions, or other aspects of the Online Services. In surveys, in addition to other Personal Information, the Company or a third party may ask you to provide birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time ("Survey Information"). The Company may also collect such Survey Information from another source and use that information in combination with information provided from the Site and other surveys. Provision of Personal Information through surveys is completely voluntary and you are not required to respond to surveys as a term or condition of purchasing a good or service from the Company.</p>

			<h4>Cookies. </h4>

			<p>The Company currently uses cookie technology to associate Internet-related information about you with information about you in its database. The Company may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party providers, including but not limited to Google Analytics features (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting). The Company may employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, which allow the Company to store a small piece of data on a visitor's computer (or any other device a visitor uses to access Online Services) about the visit to the Site or use of the Applications. Further, the Company may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to the Site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on Site usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; and, save your password for ease of access to the Site.</p>

			<p>You can disable cookies. If you disable cookies, you may use the Site, but your ability to use all of the features and functionality of the Site, such as order forms, may be limited or impacted. Your browser settings can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about cookies at http://www.cookiecentral.com.</p>

			<h4>Web Beacons. </h4>

			<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs or web beacons, which is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page. Web beacons also can be used by Us to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information (which could include Personal Information) about an individual in the database. This helps us track certain websites you visit, behavioral habits for marketing purposes, and referrals from partners and affiliates. Pleas note, in addition to using web beacons on web pages, the Company also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals in its database. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are imbedded invisibly on web pages or email.</p>

			<h4>Third Party Tracking. </h4>

			<p>The use of tracking technologies by service providers, technology partners or other third parties (such as social media links) on the Site is not covered by our Privacy Policy. These third parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on the Site. We do not have access or control over these technologies.</p>

			<h4>Testimonials and Reviews. </h4>

			<p>We may display personal testimonials of satisfied customers received through surveys or otherwise. We do not pay for or provide any consideration in exchange for testimonials, unless otherwise indicated on our Site. We ask for your specific consent as part of a survey. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact the company at support@keto-one.com. We may also display customer reviews.</p>

			<h4>Calls and Electronic Communications. </h4>

			<p>In the regular course of business, We (or our customer service vendor) may monitor and record phone conversations or email communications with you for training and quality assurance purposes. We may receive confirmation when you open or click on content in an email from Us, which helps Us improve our communications with you. If you do not wish to receive email from Us, you may unsubscribe from the mailing list on any of the emails We send to you.</p>

			<h4>No Information from Children. </h4>

			<p>We do not target or market to children. The Company will never knowingly collect any Personal Information about or from a child under the age of 13. If the Company obtains actual knowledge that it has collected Personal Information about a child under the age of 13, that information will immediately be deleted from its database. The Company, moreover, employs all reasonable measures to ensure that it markets and sells its products to consumers that are of legal age under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they reside, and Company will never knowingly collect any Personal Information about or from a consumer that is not of legal age.</p>

			<h3>Use of Information</h3>

			<p>We use information We collect from you for a host of reasons. For example, We may use your information to communicate with you, process orders, facilitate your transactions with Us or our third party affiliates and marketing partners, and inform you of offers and discounts in the future. We may also, for example, monetize and share your information, or use your information to analyze and optimize Our marketing efforts. To provide you clarity, this section sets forth how the Company currently uses or has a right to use information it collects from you.</p>

			<h4>Email and Unsubscribe Policy. </h4>

			<p>The Company uses Personal Information to provide first and third party promotional offers and newsletters by email. The Company may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If you wish to end an email subscription from a particular list, you must follow the instructions at the end of each email message in order to unsubscribe to from a particular list. You may also unsubscribe from all Company email lists by sending an email to support@keto-one.com.</p>

			<p>The Company does not send unsolicited emails. The Company only sends email to recipients who have agreed on the Site to receive email from the Company or to recipients who have agreed on a third party website to receive emails from third parties.</p>

			<p>The Company may share your Personal Information with companies that provide support services to Us (e.g., printer, email service and customer service providers) or help Us market or fulfill Our services and products. Third parties are authorized only to use your Personal Information for the purposes authorized in this Privacy Policy.</p>

			<p>Please note, the unsubscribe process for the Company's electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe your information from any third party users of the data. You may still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf of third parties and your Personal Information may be shared with third parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends unless you unsubscribe as provided above. Because third parties maintain separate databases, you will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if desired. This allows you to pick and choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.</p>

			<p>Generally, you may not opt out of service-related or transactional communications, which are not promotional, unless your account with Us is terminated and obligations satisfied.</p>

			<h4>Content of Email Communications. </h4>

			<p>You may receive commercial email messages sent by third parties for products or services which may be of interest to you. In such case, the advertiser's name will appear in the "From" and the email will have a method at the bottom of the email to unsubscribe from that advertiser. The Company, however, is not responsible for the content of third party emails or the conduct of the advertisers.</p>

			<h4>Visitor Demographics and Targeted Advertising. </h4>

			<p>Contact Data and Traffic Data are used to gather statistics about customers and visitors. We may use data collected from you, including Demographic Data, to generate collective information about our users or to identify users specifically. The Company may use collected data to target advertising to an individual, including using technology to associate an individual with that person's Personal Information in order to show advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an interest in surveys or otherwise indicated an interest based on the technological information. In its discretion, the Company may target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.</p>

			<h4>Telemarketing. </h4>

			<p>The Company may use your Personal Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones. You may have your telephone number listed on a state or federal do-not-call registry. By registering and using the Online Services, you provide consent to the Company and its agents or vendors to contact you by telephone, including the use of automated, predictive, programmable, or similar dialers or dialing software, as allowed under applicable law. Further, if you reside outside of the United States, by registering and using the Online Services, you acknowledge that the processing of your Personal Information may involve the transfer of such Personal Information within or outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") to countries within or outside the EEA whose data protection regulation may not be as stringent as that within the European Union. We may use Personal Information to provide goods and services you have requested, including services that display customized content and advertising.</p>
